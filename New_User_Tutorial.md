-If this is your first time, click the "Register" button.  If not, type in your email address and password and press the "Sign in" button.
-Fill out every space on the registration page:
    -Email address and Password you should remember or note down, because you will need these to log in.
    -Note: the only email addresses accepted are ones that end with @colorado.edu
    -Also, for testing purposes, it is useful to select multiple classes to showcase the full functionality of the site.
-Once finished adding your information, press the "Submit" button.  You will be rerouted to the login page.
-Type your email address and password into the areas provided and press the "Sign in" button.
-You are now on your home page.
    -Your name is populated under a blank picture
    -A "To Do" form on the far left is populated with the classes you selected when you registered.
    -To populate the main page, fill out none, all, or any of the fields on the "To Do" form with assignments (ex: Assignment 5)
    -Press "Submit".
    -Notice the main page populates with other users that have also selected that class to work on with a particular assignment
    -Only the classes you provided input for in the "To Do" form will show up on the main page area. =>if you press "Submit" with no text under any of the classes, your main page area will not display any classes or people.  This is a good way to become invisible to others as you will not show up on their main pages as well.
    -To change or update your location and location description, populate the form above "Todo Do" and press "Submit".  Your homepage will reload and the changes will be visible on your main page.
    -To edit your profile information, press "Edit Profile" on the top right of the page.  This will bring you to our Edit Profile page, which changes the database information of the user.  Every field needs to be filled out to submit. Upon submission, you will be rerouted to your home page which will show the updated information in your "To do" form and "Name".
    -The buffalo logo in the upper left corner of the home page can be used to refresh the homepage.
    -To logout, press the "Logout" button in the upper right corner of the home page.  This will bring you back to the login page.  Because the cookies that keep track of the current user are deleted at Logout, you will need to login again to access your home page.  Note: the cookies are also deleted when you close your browser window, so another login will also be necessary in that case.  to test this, try https://meetnwork-softwaredev.herokuapp.com/home or https://meetnwork-softwaredev.herokuapp.com/edit_profile.  In both cases, you can access them after login, but not if you have logged out, or if you have closed your browser window; in each of these cases, you will be rerouted back to the login page https://meetnwork-softwaredev.herokuapp.com/login.
    
If you are having difficulties, cookie blockers might be the culprit.  Try disabling them and trying again.

Have fun!
